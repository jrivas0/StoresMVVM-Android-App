# Stores

Stores is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to add and view a list of stores. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, utilizing Room for local database storage, Volley for network operations, and LiveData for reactive data handling and UI updates.

## Features

- **Add Stores**: Users can add new store information, including name, address, contact details and an image of the store.
- **Store List**: Displays a list of stores using RecyclerView with options to view, edit, delete store entries or even call to the store number.
- **Local Database Storage**: Utilizes Room Persistence Library to store store information locally.
- **Network Operations**: Uses Volley library to perform network operations for fetching store data.
